# flutter-starter
Provides a template and starting point for Flutter projects. 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. You can simply copy
the entire folder to a different location, change the project and package name
and get started.

Step 1 - Change Project name
a) The project name is defined in the ```pubspec.yaml``` file. 
Change the project ```name:``` and ```description:```` properties

b) Change the name of the IDEA IML file ```starter.iml``` to match the project
name e.g.
> mv starter.iml basic.iml

Step 2 - Change the Package name

Change the package name for your app by following the instructions here
https://pub.dev/packages/change_app_package_name

The Template already has the following configured
1) Theme
2) Firebase for logging
3) Firestore using a secondary firebase instance
4) Notifications using the secondary firebase instance
