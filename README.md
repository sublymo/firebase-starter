# flutter-starter
Provides a template and starting point for Flutter projects. 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. You can simply copy
the entire folder to a different location, change the project and package name
and get started.

Step 1 - Change Project name
a) The project name is defined in the ```pubspec.yaml``` file. 
Change the project ```name:``` and ```description:```` properties

b) Change the name of the IDEA IML file ```starter.iml``` to match the project
name e.g.
> mv starter.iml basic.iml

Step 2 - Change the Package name

Change the package name for your app by following the instructions here

[Changing Flutter Package Name](https://pub.dev/packages/change_app_package_name)

Step 3 (Optional) - Change the App Theme and Build flavors 
The Template already has the following configured but may need additional changes
1) App Theme Customization
2) Support for dev and prod build flavors
3) Logger to log applications events and messaegs

The setup for dev and prod environments is based on the following document
- [Configure App Flavors in Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/flavors)
